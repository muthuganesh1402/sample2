		<p>Swarm robots use a coordinated shared intelligence to operate as a group and work in coordination. These applications require the use of wireless communication for fast and efficient communications. Our system uses this concept to apply it in a pair of swarm robots that are based on a master slave relationship. The master robot is integrated with IR sensors to perform a specific task. In this case the master has a circuitry that consists of an integrated IR sensing circuit controller by a microcontroller circuit that is used to follow a line. The IR sensors are used to sense the line drawn and follow using reflected light principle of operation. While performing its operation the controller also transmits the movement commands to the slave robot using Rf communication. The slave robot consists of an microcontroller circuit integrated with similar motorized robotic body as the master. It receives the commands sent by master and operates the motors in order to achieve motion as per commands sent by the master. Thus we successfully achieve a master slave communication through the use of swarm robotics concepts.</p>

		<p>Here we propose a smart floor cleaning robot that allows for remote floor cleaning. The bot makes floor cleaning very easy and a fast process using a wireless robotic cleaning system. The user may sit at a place, start a bot and clean wherever needed. The system consists of a transmitter app. This app is run in an android mobile phone that allows user to transmit command based on user input. Based on these commands the transmitter sends movement commands to the robot. The transmitter is an android mobile phone that allows user to transmit commands to the robot. The robot consists of 2 cleaning pads with a water sprayer for efficient cleaning. The robot has 2 motorized rotating cleaning scrubs for the cleaning part. On receiving the movement commands from the android. On receiving the movement commands from the android device through Bluetooth receiver. The microcontroller on receiving the commands, decodes them and thus operates the motors in order to achieve the desired motion. Even the sprayer and cleaner mechanism can be controlled by the android app user. This makes floor cleaning a very easy, fast and an effortless process.

		<h3 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;color:#E2E03E">Motion Based Maze Solver Using Android </h3>

		<p>Here we propose a motion controller maze solving system that detects android device alignment to solve the maze. We use a mini maze game to display the demonstration of this system. The system consists of an android app used to transmit the commands through Bluetooth to the receiver system. The receiver circuit receives these commands using Bluetooth receiver which are then processed by the microcontroller. The microcontroller now instructs a set of servo motors to align the maze as per alignment commands received and matches the maze alignment as per android phone’s. The microcontroller constantly checks the maze alignment and compares it with the phone alignment in order to match it at every moment. This allows for instant maze platform movements as per the android phone. Thus we achieve an innovative maze solver game using an android phone.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;color:#E2E03E">Wearable Health Monitoring System Project </h3>

		<p>We live in the wearable technology era. Electronics have now evolved to wearable tech for ease of use and advancements. Monitoring a patients health status requires constantly measuring his/her pulse rates. So here we propose a battery powered wearable health monitoring system that constantly monitors patient heart pulses and displays it to user through a wearable band. The system makes use of heart rate sensor to read user pulses and then display it on a display. Also it transmits these values over to the users android phone through Bluetooth module for storing data on the phone. Our system uses an Atmega microcontroller based circuit with sensor and Bluetooth circuitry that is powered by a 9V battery to achieve this task. This system will help many in keeping track of their health and staying fit by tracking their health stats on a phone.</p>
